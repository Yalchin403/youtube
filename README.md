## About

This repository is a collection of code samples, projects, and examples that I use in my YouTube videos. The purpose of this repository is to provide easy access to the source code for viewers who want to follow along, experiment, or use the code as a starting point for their own projects.

## Repository Structure

Each project or code sample is organized into its own directory, named after the corresponding YouTube video or topic. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- Projects
- A README.md file with specific instructions for that project

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository to find the project or code sample you're interested in.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the specific project directory.
4. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md file to set up and run the code.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to suit your needs!
